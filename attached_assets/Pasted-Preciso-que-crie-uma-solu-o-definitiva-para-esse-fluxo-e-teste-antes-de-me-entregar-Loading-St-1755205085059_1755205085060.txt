I can see the project is in a stable state with all major systems functioning correctly. The rental platform is fully operational with proper anti-fraud protection, authentication, payment processing, and digital contract signing.

What would you like me to work on next? I can help with:

Adding new features to the platform
Improving existing functionality
Performance optimizations
User interface enhancements
Mobile app development
Administrative tools
Analytics and reporting
Security improvements
Or any other specific requirements you have
Just let me know what you'd like to focus on and I'll get started right away.
